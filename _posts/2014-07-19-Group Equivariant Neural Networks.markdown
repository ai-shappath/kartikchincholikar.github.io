description: We know that a rotated fish is still a fish. How can we design
  Neural Network architectures which respect such facts(Symmetries)? Equivariant
  Neural Networks leverage knowledge of the symmetries of a learning problem to
  improve data efficiency, and have been shown to enjoy better scaling behavior
  than non-equivariant methods in problems with symmetries. Symmetries can be
  found in many applications of machine learning, such as medical imaging, drug
  design, materials design, analysis of protein structure, global climate
  modeling, lattice gauge theory, cryo-electron microscopy, graph-structured
  data, combinatorial optimization, robotics, and many others.
