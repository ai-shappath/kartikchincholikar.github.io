  Can we have a certificate of guarantee in a quality control sense for Neural Networks? NO. Neural Network are too wiggly, hence they always overfit. But all hope is not lost. Neural Networks combined with human supervision and good design leads to faster workflows. We must empirically verify if a Neural Network's precision/recall is good enough for the task at hand.
