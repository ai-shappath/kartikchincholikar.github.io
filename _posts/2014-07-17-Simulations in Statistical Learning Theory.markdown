description: Can we have a certificate of guarantee in a quality control sense for Neural Networks? NO. Neural Network are too wiggly, hence they always overfit. But all hope is not lost- Neural Networks combined with human supervision and good design leads to faster workflows. We must empirically verify if a Neural Network's precision/recall is good enough for the task at hand.
