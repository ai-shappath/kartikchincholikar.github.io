mash up of quotes which motivate this video:  
Real datasets actually contain a tremendous amount of structure, or else we could not learn from them. It is only slightly overstating the case to say that physics is the study of symmetry. The manifold hypothesis is that real life high-dimensional data of interest often lives in an unknown lower-dimensional manifold embedded in ambient space.
